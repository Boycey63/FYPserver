# FYP Servere

The goal of this project is to create a web application and a mobile application directed towards small businesses that are having trouble getting customers. It will also be targeted towards people who need to find a local business. 

These applications will have two main roles, a general customer role and a business’s owner role. The user will have the ability to perform different functions depending on which role they choses. For example, a business will be able to create a business profile and view the reviews that have been made on theory business. Whereas, a general customer will be able to find businesses based in their location, write a review on a business, and view other people’s reviews. 

One of the main objectives of the project is to implement a review system that used a machine learning algorithm to give a rating based on what the user has input as review text. The rating will be predicted based on the previous reviews made on the system.

The Project was completed and implementations of the above descripition were made.
